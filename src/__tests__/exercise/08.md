# testing custom hooks

## Background

Testing custom hooks is a common question as well. Step back and think about how
our guiding testing principle applies to this situation: the more your tests
resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
How is your custom hook used? It's used in a component! So that's how it should
be tested.

Often, the easiest and most straightforward way to test a custom hook is to
create a component that uses it and then test that component instead.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we have gone back to our simple counter, except now that logic
is all in a custom hook and we need to test that functionality. To do that,
we'll make a test component that uses the hook in the typical way that our hook
will be used and then test that component, indirectly testing our hook.

## Extra Credit

### 1. ðŸ’¯ fake component

Sometimes it's hard to write a test component without making a pretty
complicated "TestComponent." For those situations, you can try something like
this:

```javascript
let result
function TestComponent(props) {
  result = useCustomHook(props)
  return null
}

// interact with and assert on results here
```

### 2. ðŸ’¯ setup function

Add tests titled:

1. allows customization of the initial count
2. allows customization of the step

And test those use cases. Then abstract away the common logic into a `setup`
function. This one might be a little tricky thanks to variable references, but I
know you can do it!

ðŸ’° Here's a little tip. Due to variable references, you'll need to change your
test component a bit:

```javascript
const results = {}
function TestComponent(props) {
  Object.assign(results, useCustomHook())
  return null
}

// interact with and assert on results here
```

### 3. ðŸ’¯ using react-hooks testing library

Your `setup` function is very similar to the `renderHook` function from
[`@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)!
Swap your own `setup` function with that!

> NOTE: Originally this exercise used `@testing-library/react-hooks` which was
> similar, but that functionality was merged directly into
> `@testing-library/react` so you're going to use that instead.

## ðŸ¦‰ Elaboration and Feedback

After the instruction, if you want to remember what you've just learned, then
fill out the elaboration and feedback form:

Do not forget about the guiding testing principle: â€˜the more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.â€™
Most of the time we need to test custom hooks in a tested components as custom hooks are often consumed there. However, itâ€™s possible (not advisable) to test custom hooks.
Ways to test custom hooks:

1. Create a test component that uses the hook and test that component
2. If thereâ€™s a customization needed when calling a hook, itâ€™s better to create a function like in the screenshot below (check notes)
Or this for some cases when itâ€™s difficult to create component to resemble how the hook is used and when no customization required (check notes)
3. Use renderHook from the React Testing Library https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#renderhook

Note, youÂ canÂ test more than a single hook by simply calling all the hooks you want in the callback function you pass toÂ renderHook.
const {result} = renderHook(useCounter) vs  const {result} = renderHook(() => useCounter({initialCount: 2, step: 2}))  when we need to pass args, we can make the callback to be called to call the hook. In the first case, we donâ€™t need it to be called with any args, so we can pass it as is and itâ€™ll be called by the renderHook
